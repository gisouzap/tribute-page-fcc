      <h1 class="section-title">About Patrick</h1>
      <p>It all began when Pat Rothfuss was born to a marvelous set of parents.
        Throughout his formative years they encouraged him to do his best, gave him good advice,
        and were no doubt appropriately dismayed when he failed to live up to his full potential.
      </p><br />
      <p>In high-school Pat was something of a class clown. His hobbies included reading a novel
        or two a day and giving relationship advice to all his friends despite the fact that
        he had never so much as kissed a girl. He also role-played and wrote terrible stories
        about elves. He was pretty much a geek. </p> <br />

      <p>Most of Pat's adult life has been spent in the University Wisconsin Stevens Point.
        In 1991 he started college in order to pursue a career in chemical engineering,
        then he considered clinical psychology. In 1993 he quit pretending he knew what
        he wanted to do with his life, changed his major to "undecided," and proceeded
        to study whatever amused him. He also began writing a book... </p><br />

      <p>For the next seven years Pat studied anthropology, philosophy, eastern religions,
        history, alchemy, parapsychology, literature, and writing. He studied six different
        martial arts, practiced improv comedy, learned how to pick locks, and became a skilled
        lover of women. He also began writing a satirical advice column which he continues
        to this day: The College Survivial Guide. Through all of this he continued to work
        on his novel. </p><br />

      <p>In 2000 Pat went to grad school for English literature.
        Grad school sucked and Pat hated it. However, Pat learned that he loved to teach.
        He left in 2002 with his masters degree, shaking the dust from his feet and vowing
        never to return. During this period of time his novel was rejected by roughly every
        agent in the known universe. </p><br />

      <p>Now Pat teaches half-time at his old school as an assistant-sub-lecturer.
        He is underpaid but generally left alone to do as he sees fit with his classes.
        He is advisor for the college feminists, the fencing club, and, oddly enough,
        a sorority. He still roll-plays occasionally, but now he does it in an extremely
        sophisticated, debonair way. </p><br />

      <p> Through a series of lucky breaks, he has wound up with the best agent and editor
        imaginable, and the first book of his trilogy has been published under the title
        "The Name of the Wind." </p><br />
      <p>Though it has only been out since April 2007, it has already been sold in 26 foreign
        countries and won several awards. </p><br />
      <p>Pat has been described as "a rough, earthy iconoclast with a pipeline
        to the divine in everyone's subconscious." But honestly,
        that person was pretty drunk at the time, so you might want to take it with a grain of salt.</p><br />
